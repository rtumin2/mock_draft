# mock_draft
This is my mock draft program.  It allows for keepers and some simple league roster settings.

You can alter the settings by changing the settings.txt file, or you can rename/delete it and insert everything in the program.
The rankings are taken directly from ESPN's top 200, and I might add more rankings eventually.
Results of the draft will be saved in results.txt.
